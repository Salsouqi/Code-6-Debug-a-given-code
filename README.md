1. In the first cell "Function to check if a number is prime" I changed the lines to where the indentations were correctly aligned with the intial line. Also added the line " if number == 2: return true", to have a conditional statement that comapres the input and if it is equal to the number "2", then return "True".

2. In the fourth cell "Swap start and end if start is greater" I simply rearranged the the variables to where if the start number is larger than the end or second number inputted, THEN, switch the places of the two numbers to have the end number first in the arrangement with the first number then following it.
